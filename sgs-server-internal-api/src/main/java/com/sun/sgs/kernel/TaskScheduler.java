/**
 * This interface is used to run tasks that may take an arbitrarily long time
 * to complete, but are expected to complete eventually. These tasks may be
 * scheduled to run immediately or after some delay, possibly re-executing at
 * regular intervals.
 * <p>
 * Based on an implementation's policy, a task and its owner, that task may
 * not be accepted for execution. In this case {@code TaskRejectedException}
 * is thrown. To ensure that a task will be accepted methods are provided to
 * get a {@code TaskReservation}. This is especially useful for {@code Service}
 * methods working within a transaction that need to ensure that a task will
 * be accepted before they can commit.
 * <p>
 * Note that, because the tasks submitted through this interface may run
 * any length of time, there are no guarantees about when a given task
 * will start. If a task is scheduled to run immediately, or at some point
 * in the future, then this means that the scheduler will try to acquire
 * resources to run the task at that point. It may still be some indefinite
 * length of time before the task can actually be run.
