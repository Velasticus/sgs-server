/**
 * Used to report to the {@link AccessCoordinator} when access is
 * requested to a shared object. Methods must be called in the context
 * of an active transaction, or provide a transaction in which the
 * context of the request took place.  The latter option is primarily
 * provided for services to report accesses that were only detected
 * during the prepare phase when the transaction is no longer active.
 * <p>
 * All methods of {@code AccessReporter} take an object identifier as a
 * parameter. This parameter must implement {@code equals()} and
 * {@code hashCode()}. To make the resulting detail provided to the
 * profiler as useful as possible, the identifier should have a meaningful
 * {@code toString()} method. Other than this the identifier may be any
 * arbitrary instance, including the requested object itself, as long as
 * it uniquely identifies the object across transactions.
 * <p>
 * For the {@code reportObjectAccess} methods, access should be
 * reported as early as possible. In particular, if actually resolving
 * or retrieving the object could fail, or incur any significant
 * expense, the report should be made first. This is to ensure that
 * access is always noted, and has the chance to abort the transaction
 * before any unneeded processing is done. For instance, in the case
 * of the {@code DataService}, before a name binding is resolved in
 * the {@code getBinding} method, the requested access to that bound
 * object should be reported.
 * <p>
 * If the implementation of the {@code reportObjectAccess} methods detect a
 * conflict and wish to cause the calling transaction to fail, they will abort
 * the transaction and then throw a {@link TransactionAbortedException}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the identifier used to identify accessed objects
