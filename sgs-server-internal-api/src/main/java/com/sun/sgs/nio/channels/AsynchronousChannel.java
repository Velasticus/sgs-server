/**
 * A channel that supports asynchronous operations.
 * <p>
 * Asynchronous channels are non-blocking and define methods to initiate
 * asynchronous operations of the form:
 * <pre>
 *  IoFuture&lt;R,A&gt; operation(... CompletionHandler&lt;R,A&gt; handler)
 * </pre>
 * The returned IoFuture represents the pending result of the asynchronous
 * operation on the channel, and R is the result type returned by the
 * IoFuture's get method.
 * <p>
 * The IoFuture's isDone method can be used to poll the operation to test if
 * it has completed. The IoFuture's get() method can be used wait
 * indefinitely for the result of the operation, and the get(long,TimeUnit)
 * method can be used to wait for at most a given time. If the operation
 * does not complete normally then the get method throws an
 * ExecutionException with the appropriate cause.
 * <p>
 * When an operation on an asynchronous channel completes (successfully or
 * due to error) then a completion handler is invoked to consume the result.
 * The handler is specified when the asynchronous operation is initiated. If
 * a completion handler is not required then it can be specified as null.
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous channel is bound to an asynchronous channel group. The
 * group can be specified when the channel is constructed. If a group is not
 * specified then the channel is bound to a default group. Once a channel is
 * created it remains bound to the group until the channel is closed. This
 * class does not define a method to obtain the group to which the channel
 * is bound. Each group has an associated ExecutorService to which tasks are
 * submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch the results to completion
 * handlers. The completion handler is guaranteed to be invoked by either
 * the thread that initiated the operation or from a task executed by the
 * associated executor service.
 * 
 * <h3>Closing, Cancellation, Timeouts, and Concurrency</h3>
 * <p>
 * Invoking the close method on an asynchronous channel arranges for all
 * outstanding operations on the channel to complete by throwing
 * ExecutionException with cause AsynchronousCloseException.
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous operation is cancelled by invoking the cancel method on
 * the IoFuture representing the result of the operation. It is
 * implementation, channel, and operation specific whether an asynchronous
 * operation can be cancelled. If an operation can be cancelled then the
 * completion handler is invoked and the IoFuture's get method throws
 * CancellationException. If the cancel method is invoked with the
 * mayInterruptIfRunning parameter set to the value true then an
 * implementation may close the channel as if by invoking the close method.
 * In that case then all outstanding operations on the channel complete by
 * throwing ExecutionException with cause AsynchronousCloseException.
 * <p>
 * Some channel implementations may allow a timeout to be specified when
 * initiating an asynchronous operation. If the timeout elapses before the
 * operation completes then the operation completes by throwing
 * ExecutionException with cause AbortedByTimeoutException. Depending on the
 * channel type, a timeout may put the channel into an error state that
 * prevents further operations on the channel.
 * <p>
 * Asynchronous channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 * Some channel implementations may support concurrent reading and writing,
 * but may not allow more than one read or write to be outstanding at any
 * given time.
 * <p>
 * Read and write operations on asynchronous channels will typically involve
 * reading into or writing from a ByteBuffer, or a sequence of buffers.
 * Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care
 * should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation completes.
