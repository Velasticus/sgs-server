/**
 * An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous server-socket channel is created by invoking the
 * {@link AsynchronousServerSocketChannel#open(AsynchronousChannelGroup) open}
 * method of this class. A newly-created asynchronous server-socket channel
 * is open but not yet bound. It can be bound to a local address and
 * configured to listen for connections by invoking the
 * {@link AsynchronousServerSocketChannel#bind(SocketAddress, int) bind}
 * method. Once bound, the
 * {@link AsynchronousServerSocketChannel#accept(Object, CompletionHandler)
 * accept} method is used to initiate the accepting of connections
 * to the channel's socket. An attempt to invoke the {@code accept} method on
 * an unbound channel will cause a {@link NotYetBoundException} to be thrown.
 * <p>
 * Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads
 * though at most one accept operation can be outstanding at any time. If a
 * thread initiates an accept operation before a previous accept operation
 * has completed then an {@link AcceptPendingException} will be thrown.
 * Whether or not an operation is pending may be determined by invoking the
 * {@link AsynchronousServerSocketChannel#isAcceptPending isAcceptPending}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * Socket options are configured using the
 * {@link AsynchronousServerSocketChannel#setOption setOption} method.
 * Channels of this type support the following options:
 * <blockquote>
 *   <table>
 *     <tr>
 *       <th>Option Name</th>
 *       <th>Description</th>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF}</td>
 *       <td>The size of the socket receive buffer</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR}</td>
 *       <td>Re-use address</td>
 *     </tr>
 *   </table>
 * </blockquote>
 * and may support additional (implementation specific) options. The list of
 * options supported is obtained by invoking the
 * {@link NetworkChannel#options options} method.
 * 
 * <h4>Usage Example:</h4>
 * <pre>
 *   final AsynchronousServerSocketChannel listener = 
 *       AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.open().bind(
 *           new InetSocketAddress(5000));
 * 
 *   listener.accept(
 *     new CompletionHandler&lt;AsynchronousSocketChannel,Void&gt;() {
 *       public void completed(IoFuture&lt;AsynchronousSocketChannel,Void&gt; 
 *                             result) 
 *       {
 *           try {
 *               AsynchronousSocketChannel ch = result.getNow();
 *               :
 *           } catch (ExecutionException x) { .. } 
 * 
 *           // accept the next connection
 *           listener.accept(this);
 *       }
 *   });
