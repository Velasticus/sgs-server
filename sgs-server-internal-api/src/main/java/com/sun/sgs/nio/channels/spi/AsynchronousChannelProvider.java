/**
 * Service-provider class for asynchronous channels.
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous channel provider is a concrete subclass of this class
 * that has a zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract methods
 * specified below. A given invocation of the Java virtual machine maintains
 * a single system-wide default provider instance, which is returned by the
 * {@link #provider} method. The first invocation of that method will locate
 * the default provider as specified below.
 * <p>
 * If the system-wide default provider implements
 * {@link ManagedChannelFactory} then the management interfaces for the
 * pools of channels created by the provider will be included in the list of
 * {@link ChannelPoolMXBean} objects returned by the
 * {@link Channels#getChannelPoolMXBeans} method
 * [[NOT IMPLEMENTED: and also registered with the platform {@link MBeanServer}
 * when the {@code MBeanServer} is obtained by invoking the
 * {@link ManagementFactory#getPlatformMBeanServer} method]].
 * To ensure that the {@link ObjectName} for uniquely identifying the
 * {@code ChannelPoolMXBean} objects is unique it is recommended that the
 * <i>pool name</i> is "asynchronous.<i>name</i>" where <i>name</i>
 * identifies the provider's channel pool.
 * <p>
 * All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 * threads.
 * <p>
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED: {@code openAsynchronousFileChannel}
