/**
 * A channel to a network socket.

 * A channel that implements this interface is a channel to a network
 * socket. The {@link #bind} method is used to bind the socket to a local
 * {@link SocketAddress address}, the {@link #getLocalAddress} method
 * returns the address that the socket is bound to, and the
 * {@link #setOption} and {@link #getOption} methods are used to set and
 * query socket options. An implementation of this interface should specify
 * the socket options that it supports.
 * <p>
 * The {#link #bind} and {@link #setOption} methods that do not otherwise
 * have a value to return are specified to return the network channel upon
 * which they are invoked. This allows method invocations to be chained.
 * Implementations of this interface should specialize the return type so
 * that method invocations on the implementation class can be chained.
