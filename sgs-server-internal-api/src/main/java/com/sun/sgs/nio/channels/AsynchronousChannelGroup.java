/**
 * An organization of asynchronous channels for the purpose of resource
 * sharing.
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous channel group encapsulates the mechanics required to
 * handle the completion of I/O operations initiated by
 * {@link AsynchronousChannel asynchronous channels} that are bound to the
 * group. A group is created with an {@link ExecutorService} to which tasks
 * are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to
 * {@link CompletionHandler completion handlers} that consume the result of
 * asynchronous operations performed on channels in the group.
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous channel group is created by invoking the {@link #open}
 * method. Channels are bound to a group by specifying the group when the
 * channel is constructed. If a group is not specified then the channel is
 * bound to a <em>default group</em> that is constructed automatically.
 * The executor for the default group is created by invoking the
 * {@link ThreadPoolFactory#newThreadPool() newThreadPool} method on a
 * {@link ThreadPoolFactory} located as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> If the system property
 * {@code java.nio.channels.DefaultThreadPoolFactory} is defined then it is
 * taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete thread pool factory
 * class. The class is loaded and instantiated.
 * <li> If the system property is not defined, or the process to load and
 * instantiate it fails, then a system-default factory class is
 * instantiated.
 * </ul>
 * <h4>Shutdown and Termination</h4>
 * The {@link #shutdown} method is used to initiate an
 * <em>orderly shutdown</em> of the group. An orderly shutdown marks the
 * group as shutdown; further attempts to construct a channel that binds to
 * the group will throw {@link ShutdownChannelGroupException}. Whether or
 * not a group is shutdown can be tested using the {@link #isShutdown}
 * method. Once shutdown, a group <em>terminates</em> when all
 * asynchronous channels that are bound to the group are closed and
 * resources used by the group are released. Once a group is terminated then
 * any actively executing completion handlers run to completion; no attempt
 * is made to stop or interrupt threads that are executing completion
 * handlers. The {@link #isTerminated} method is used to test if the group
 * has terminated, and the {@link #awaitTermination} method can be used to
 * block until the group has terminated.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #shutdownNow} method can be used to initiate a
 * <em>forceful shutdown</em> of the group. In addition to the actions
 * performed by an orderly shutdown, the {@code shutdownNow} method closes
 * all open channels in the group as if by invoking the
 * {@link AsynchronousChannel#close close} method. A group will typically
 * terminate quickly after the {@code shutdownNow} method has been invoked.
