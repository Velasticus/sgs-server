/**
 * An asynchronous channel for datagram-oriented sockets.
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous datagram channel is created by invoking one of the open
 * methods defined by this class. It is not possible to create a channel for
 * an arbitrary, pre-existing datagram socket. A newly-created asynchronous
 * datagram channel is open but not connected. It need not be connected in
 * order for the send and receive methods to be used. A datagram channel may
 * be connected, by invoking its connect method, in order to avoid the
 * overhead of the security checks that are otherwise performed as part of
 * every send and receive operation when a security manager is set. The
 * channel must be connected in order to use the read and write methods,
 * since those methods do not accept or return socket addresses. Once
 * connected, an asynchronous datagram channel remains connected until it is
 * disconnected or closed.
 * <p>
 * Socket options are configured using the setOption method. Channels of
 * this type support the following options:
 * <blockquote>
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Option Name</th>
 * <th>Description</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF}</td>
 * <td>The size of the socket send buffer</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF}</td>
 * <td>The size of the socket receive buffer</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR}</td>
 * <td>Re-use address</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_BROADCAST SO_BROADCAST}</td>
 * <td>Allow transmission of broadcast datagrams</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#IP_TOS IP_TOS}</td>
 * <td>The Type of Service (ToS) octet in the Internet Protocol (IP) header</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#IP_MULTICAST_IF IP_MULTICAST_IF}</td>
 * <td>The network interface for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#IP_MULTICAST_TTL IP_MULTICAST_TTL}</td>
 * <td>The <em>time-to-live</em> for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast
 * datagrams</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#IP_MULTICAST_LOOP IP_MULTICAST_LOOP}</td>
 * <td>Loopback for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote>
 * and may support additional (implementation
 * specific) options. The list of options supported is obtained by invoking
 * the options method.
 * <h4>Timeouts</h4>
 * [TBD]
 * <h4>Usage Example:</h4>
 * <pre>
 *   final AsynchronousDatagramChannel dc = AsynchronousDatagramChannel.open()
 *       .bind(new InetSocketAddress(4000));
 * 
 *   // print the source address of all packets that we receive
 *   dc.receive(buffer, buffer, 
 *     new CompletionHandler&lt;SocketAddress,ByteBuffer&gt;() {
