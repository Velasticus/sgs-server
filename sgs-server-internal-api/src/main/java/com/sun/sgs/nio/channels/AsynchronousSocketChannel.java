/**
 * An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.
 * <p>
 * Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A
 * newly-created AsynchronousSocketChannel is created by invoking one of the
 * open methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is open but
 * not yet connected. A connected AsynchronousSocketChannel is created when
 * a connection is made to the socket of an AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.
 * It is not possible to create an asynchronous socket channel for an
 * arbitrary, pre-existing socket.
 * <p>
 * A newly-created channel is connected by invoking its connect method; once
 * connected, a channel remains connected until it is closed. Whether or not
 * a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking its
 * getConnectedAddress method. Whether or not a connect operation is in
 * progress may be determined by invoking the isConnectionPending method. An
 * attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected channel will cause
 * a NotYetConnectedException to be thrown.
 * <p>
 * Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 * They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read
 * operation and one write operation can be outstanding at any time. If a
 * thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
 * completed then a ReadPendingException will be thrown. Similarly, an
 * attempt to initiate a write operation before a previous write has
 * completed will throw a WritePendingException. Whether or not a read or
 * write operation is pending may be determined by invoking the
 * isReadPending and isWritePending methods.
 * <p>
 * Socket options are configured using the setOption method. Asynchronous
 * socket channels support the following options:
 * <blockquote>
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Option Name</th>
 * <th>Description</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF}</td>
 * <td>The size of the socket send buffer</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF}</td>
 * <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_KEEPALIVE SO_KEEPALIVE}</td>
 * <td>Keep connection alive</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR}</td>
 * <td>Re-use address</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>{@link StandardSocketOption#TCP_NODELAY TCP_NODELAY}</td>
 * <td>Disable the Nagle algorithm</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote>
 * and may support additional (implementation
 * specific) options. The list of options supported is obtained by invoking
 * the options method.
 * <h4>Timeouts</h4>
 * The read and write methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be
 * specified when initiating a read or write operation. If the timeout
 * elapses before an operation completes then the operation completes by
 * throwing ExecutionException with cause AbortedByTimeoutException. A
 * timeout may leave the channel, or the underlying connection, in an
 * inconsistent state. Where an implementation cannot guarantee that no
 * bytes have been read from the channel then it puts the channel into an
 * implementation specific error state and a subsequent attempt to initiate
 * a read operation throws an unspecified runtime exception. Similarly if a
 * write operation times and the implementation cannot guarantee that no
 * bytes have been written to the channel then it prohibits further write
 * operations by throwing an unspecified runtime exception.
 * <p>
 * When a timeout elapses then the state of the ByteBuffer, or the sequence
 * of buffers, for the I/O operation is not defined. Buffers should be
 * discarded or at least care must be taken to ensure that the buffers are
 * not accessed while the channel remains open.

     * hence the final position of each updated buffer, except the last
     * updated buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit.

     * If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the
