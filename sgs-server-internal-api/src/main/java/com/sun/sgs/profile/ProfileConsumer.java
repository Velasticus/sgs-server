 * A profile consumer object is used to gather profiling data for a 
 * specific system or application component.  Each profile consumer
 * has a level associated with it, which determines how much data the
 * consumer will gather.
 * <p>
 * Profile consumers are factories for profile counters, operations,
 * and samples.  These profiling data objects come in three varieties:
 * <ul>
 * <li> aggregate, where the data is collected until it is explicitly cleared
 * <li> task-local, where data is collected on a task-by-task basis into a 
 *      {@link ProfileReport}
 * <li> aggregate and task-local, where the data is both aggregated until
 *      cleared and reported on a task-by-task basis
 * </ul>
 *
 * The factory methods include a parameter indicating the minimum profile
 * level the consumer must be set at for the created object's profiling
 * data to be collected.
