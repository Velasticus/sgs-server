/**
 * 
 * The Node Mapping Service has the following responsibilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li> maintain mapping of active identities to nodes, and vice versa
 * <li> decide when the mapping should change (e.g. when a new
 *      client joins the system, a client account is canceled, an AI object
 *      is created, node failure, load balancing, an identity is quiescent)
 * <li> notify interested services of changes in the mapping
 * </ul>
 * 
 * While decisions about changes to the map will be made outside a 
 * transaction, the actual mapping change will occur inside a transaction.
 * Services can assume the mapping has not changed during one of their own
 * transactions.
 * <p>
 * On initial client login, the {@link ClientSessionService} will get a
 * node assignment via {@link #assignNode assignNode}.  If the assigned node
 * is the current node (as determined by the nodeId), the client will proceed 
 * with the login protocol.
 * Otherwise, the client will get a login response indicating a redirection,
 * and the client code should attempt to log in at the redirected node.
 * <p>
 * Mappings will be removed when the system believes an identity has become
 * quiescent, for example when a client logs out and there are no more durable
 * tasks to be run for that client's identity.  In order to determine whether an
 * identity is quiescent, services which manage resources being used on an
 * identity's behalf inform this mapping service when the identity is active
 * or inactive on a node by calling {@link #setStatus setStatus}.   The node 
 * mapping service will use this information for a simple reference counting 
 * garbage collection scheme within the map.   Status is tracked per node, so
 * services should consider only their local node state when calling setStatus.
 *              
 * <p>
 * <b> TODO We might want a transactional method that returns true if
 *     an identity is both assigned to the local node and the local node
 *     is alive, as a convenience to other services. </b>
 * <p>
 * <b> TODO A variation of "assignNode" which adds hints for identities the 
 *     input might want to colocate with will probably be added later. </b>
