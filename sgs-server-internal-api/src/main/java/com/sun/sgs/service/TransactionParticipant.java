/**
 * This interface is used by participants in transactions. Typically, each
 * implementation of <code>Service</code> will either implement
 * <code>TransactionParticipant</code> directly, or use some proxy as
 * their participant. Classes that implement
 * <code>TransactionParticipant</code> must also implement
 * <code>Serializable</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that the general model assumes that <code>Service</code>s will use
 * each other during a transaction. For instance, most <code>Service</code>s
 * will use the <code>DataService</code> to persist data. However once the
 * transaction begins to prepare or is aborted (i.e., once any of the methods
 * defined here are called on a participant), a <code>Service</code> may
 * not interact with any other <code>Service</code> in the context of that
 * transaction. Doing so results in unspecified behavior.
 * <p>
 * This interface does not specify how transaction participants learn the
 * outcome of prepared transactions following a crash.  Doing so requires a
 * separate interaction between the participant and the transaction coordinator
 * that is not specified by this interface.  Without that additional
 * communication, this interface is sufficient to support transactions with at
 * most one durable transaction participant.
