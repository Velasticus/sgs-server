/**
 * A select-based AsynchronousChannelGroup.

 * This class is a container for a set of {@link Reactor}s which do the
 * actual work of registering and dispatching asynchronous operations on
 * channels. It provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Lifecycle support: creating and configuring the {@code Reactor} set,
 * supporting {@linkplain AsynchronousChannelGroup#shutdown() graceful} and
 * {@linkplain AsynchronousChannelGroup#shutdownNow() immediate shutdown},
 * and {@linkplain AsynchronousChannelGroup#awaitTermination awaiting
 * termination}.
 * <li>Channel registration and load balancing across multiple
 * {@code Reactor}s: channels are assigned to one of the reactors in
 * the set.  Since reactors are single-threaded, the reactor set allows
 * multiple CPUs to be utilized by having multiple separate reactors.
 * </ul>
 * The default number of {@code Reactor}s is set as the number of
 * {@linkplain Runtime#availableProcessors() available processors}, but it
 * can be changed by setting the requested number in the system property
 * {@value #REACTORS_PROPERTY}.
