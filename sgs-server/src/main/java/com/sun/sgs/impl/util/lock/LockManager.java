/**
 * A class for managing lock conflicts. <p>
 *
 * This class uses the {@link Logger} named {@code com.sun.sgs.impl.util.lock}
 * to log information at the following logging levels: <p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link Level#FINER FINER} - Releasing locks; requesting, waiting for,
 *	and returning from lock requests
 * <li> {@link Level#FINEST FINEST} - Notifying new lock owners, results of
 *	requesting locks before waiting, releasing locks, results of attempting
 *	to assign locks to waiters
 * </ul> <p>
 *
 * The implementation of this class uses the following thread synchronization
 * scheme to avoid internal deadlocks:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>Synchronization is only used on {@link Locker} objects and on the {@code
 *     Map}s that hold {@link Lock} objects
 *
 * <li>A thread can synchronize on at most one locker and one lock at a time,
 *     always synchronizing on the locker first
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * To make it easier to adhere to these rules, the implementation takes the
 * following steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>The {@code Lock} class is not synchronized <p>
 *
 *     Callers of non-{@code Object} methods on the {@code Lock} class should
 *     make sure that they are synchronized on the associated key map.
 *
 * <li>The {@code Locker} class and its subclasses only use synchronization for
 *     getter and setter methods
 *
 * <li>Blocks synchronized on a {@code Lock} should not synchronize on anything
 *     else <p>
 *
 *     The implementation enforces this requirement by having lock methods not
 *     make calls to other classes, and by performing minimal work while
 *     synchronized on the associated key map.
 *
 * <li>Blocks synchronized on a {@code Locker} should not synchronize on a
 *     different locker, but can synchronize on a {@code Lock}
 *
 *     In fact, only one method synchronizes on a {@code Locker} and on a
 *     {@code Lock} -- the {@link #waitForLockInternal waitForLockInternal}
 *     method.  That method also makes sure that the only synchronized {@code
 *     Locker} methods that it calls are on the locker it has already
 *     synchronized on.
 *
 * <li>Uses assertions to check adherence to the scheme
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param	<K> the type of key
