/**
 * A scalable implementation of {@code Set} backed by a {@link
 * ScalableHashMap}.  The internal structure of the set is separated into
 * distributed pieces, which reduces the amount of data any one operation needs
 * to access.  The distributed structure increases the concurrency and allows
 * for parallel write operations to successfully complete.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Developers may use this class as a drop-in replacement for the {@link
 * java.util.HashSet} class for use in a {@link ManagedObject}.  A {@code
 * HashSet} will typically perform better than this class when the number of
 * mappings is small, the objects being stored are small, and minimal
 * concurrency is required.  As the size of the serialized {@code HashSet}
 * increases, this class will perform significantly better.  Developers are
 * encouraged to profile the serialized size of their set to determine which
 * implementation will perform better.  Note that {@code HashSet} does not
 * provide any concurrency for {@code Task}s running in parallel that attempt
 * to modify the set at the same time, so this class may perform better in
 * situations where multiple tasks need to modify the set concurrently, even if
 * the total number of elements is small.  Also note that, unlike {@code
 * HashSet}, this class can be used to store {@code ManagedObject} instances
 * directly.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * This implementation requires that all non-{@code null} elements implement
 * {@link Serializable}.  Attempting to add elements to the set that do not
 * implement {@code Serializable} will result in an {@link
 * IllegalArgumentException} being thrown.  If an element is an instance of
 * {@code Serializable} but does not implement {@code ManagedObject}, this
 * class will persist the element as necessary; when such an element is removed
 * from the set, it is also removed from the {@code DataManager}.  If an
 * element is an instance of {@code ManagedObject}, the developer will be
 * responsible for removing these objects from the {@code DataManager} when
 * done with them.  Developers should not remove these object from the {@code
 * DataManager} prior to removing them from the set.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Applications must make sure that objects used as elements in sets of this
 * class have {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods that return the same
 * values after the elements have been serialized and deserialized.  In
 * particular, elements that use {@link Object#equals Object.equals} and {@link
 * Object#hashCode Object.hashCode} will typically not be equal, and will have
 * different hash codes, each time they are deserialized, and so are probably
 * not suitable for use with this class.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * This class marks itself for update as necessary; no additional calls to the
 * {@link DataManager} are necessary when modifying the map.  Developers do not
 * need to call {@code markForUpdate} or {@code getForUpdate} on this set, as
 * this will eliminate all the concurrency benefits of this class.  However,
 * calling {@code getForUpdate} or {@code markForUpdate} can be used if a
 * operation needs to prevent all access to the set.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * This class offers constant-time implementations of the {@code add}, {@code
 * remove} and {@code contains} methods.  Note that, unlike most collections,
 * the {@code size} and {@code isEmpty} methods for this class are <em>not</em>
 * constant-time operations.  Because of the asynchronous nature of the set,
 * these operations may require accessing all of the entries in the set.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * An instance of {@code ScalableHashSet} offers one parameter for performance
 * tuning: {@code minConcurrency}, which specifies the minimum number of write
 * operations to support in parallel.  This parameter acts as a hint to the
 * backing map on how to perform resizing.  As the set grows, the number of
 * supported parallel operations will also grow beyond the specified minimum.
 * Setting the minimum concurrency too high will waste space and time, while
 * setting it too low will cause conflicts until the map grows sufficiently to
 * support more concurrent operations.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Since the expected distribution of objects in the set is essentially random,
 * the actual concurrency will vary.  Developers are strongly encouraged to use
 * hash codes that provide a normal distribution; a large number of collisions
 * will likely reduce the performance.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <a name="iterator"></a> The {@code Iterator} for this class implements
 * {@code Serializable}.  A single iterator may be saved by different {@code
 * ManagedObject} instances, which will create distinct copies of the original
 * iterator.  A copy starts its iteration from where the state of the original
 * was at the time of the copy.  However, each copy maintains a separate,
 * independent state from the original and will therefore not reflect any
 * changes to the original iterator.  To share a single {@code Iterator}
 * between multiple {@code ManagedObject} <i>and</i> have the iterator use a
 * consistent view for each, the iterator should be contained within a shared
 * {@code ManagedObject}.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * The iterator do not throw {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * The iterator for this class is stable with respect to the concurrent changes
 * to the associated collection, but may ignore additions and removals made to
 * the set during iteration.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * If a call to the {@link Iterator#next next} method on the iterator causes a
 * {@link ObjectNotFoundException} to be thrown because the return value has
 * been removed from the {@code DataManager}, the iterator will still have
 * successfully moved to the next entry in its iteration.  In this case, the
 * {@link Iterator#remove remove} method may be called on the iterator to
 * remove the current object even though that object could not be returned.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * This class and its iterator implement all optional operations and support
 * {@code null} elements.  This set provides no guarantees on the order of
 * elements when iterating.
