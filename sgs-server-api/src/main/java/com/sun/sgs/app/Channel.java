/**
 * Interface representing a communication group, a {@code Channel},
 * consisting of multiple client sessions.  Classes that implement
 * {@code Channel} must also implement {@link Serializable}.
 *
 * <p>A channel is created by invoking the {@link
 * ChannelManager#createChannel ChannelManager.createChannel} method with a
 * name, a {@code ChannelListener}, and a {@link Delivery} guarantee. A
 * {@link ClientSession} can be added or removed from a channel using that
 * {@code Channel}'s {@link #join(ClientSession) join} and {@link
 * #leave(ClientSession) leave} methods respectively.  All client sessions
 * can be removed from a channel by invoking {@link #leaveAll leaveAll} on
 * the channel.  To explicitly close a {@code Channel}, remove the {@code
 * Channel} object from the data manager using the {@link
 * DataManager#removeObject DataManager.removeObject} method.
 *
 * <p>The server can send a message to all client sessions joined to a
 * channel by using the {@link #send send} method.  Note that the methods
 * of this interface are invoked within the context of an executing {@link
 * Task}; as a result, a message sent to client sessions using the {@code
 * send} method will not be sent until after its corresponding task
 * completes.
 *
 * <p>Messages sent on a channel are delivered in a manner that satisfies
 * the channel's delivery guarantee, specified at creation time.  When
 * possible, channel messages are delivered using the most efficient means
 * to satisfy the delivery guarantee.  However, a stronger delivery
 * guarantee may be used to deliver the message if the underlying protocol
 * only supports stronger delivery guarantees.  A client session can not be
 * joined to a channel if that client session does not support a protocol
 * satisfying the minimum requirements of the channel's delivery guarantee.
 *
 * <p>A client session joined to one or more channels may become
 * disconnected due to the client logging out or due to other factors
 * such as forced disconnection or network failure.  If a client
 * session becomes disconnected, then that client session is removed
 * from each channel that it is a member of.
 *
 * <p>When the application is finished using a channel, the
 * application should remove the channel from the data manager, which
 * closes the channel and releases all resources associated with the
 * channel. 
 *
