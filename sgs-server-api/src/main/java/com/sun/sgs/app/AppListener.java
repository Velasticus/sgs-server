/**
 * Listener for application-level events.  This listener is called
 * when the application is started for the first time, and when
 * client sessions log in.
 *
 * <p>An implementation of a {@code AppListener} should implement
 * the {@link Serializable} interface, so that application listeners
 * can be stored persistently.  When an application is started for the
 * the first time, its {@link #initialize(java.util.Properties) initialize}
 * method is called and it is then persisted.  If a given listener has mutable
 * state that can be changed after this point, it should also implement 
 * the {@link ManagedObject}
 * interface.  An implementation must be public and non-abstract, and
 * have a public, no-argument constructor.
 *
 * <p>The methods of this listener are called within the context of a
 * {@link Task} being executed by the {@link TaskManager}.  If, during
 * such an execution, a task invokes one of this listener's methods
 * and that method throws an exception, that exception implements
 * {@link ExceptionRetryStatus}, and its {@link
 * ExceptionRetryStatus#shouldRetry shouldRetry} method returns
 * {@code true}, then the {@code TaskManager} will make
 * further attempts to retry the task that invoked the listener's
 * method.  It will continue those attempts until either an attempt
 * succeeds or it notices an exception is thrown that is not
 * retryable.
 *
 * <p>For a full description of task execution behavior, see the
 * documentation for {@link TaskManager#scheduleTask(Task)}.

     * invoked with a {@code boolean} that is {@code true}
     * if the client logged out gracefully, and is {@code false}
     * otherwise.

     * session.  If the application does not remove the specified
     * client session, the client session is removed when the {@link
     * ClientSessionListener#disconnected disconnected} method invoked
     * on the returned listener completes.
     * 
     * <p>A return value of {@code null} has special meaning,
     * indicating that the specified client session should not
     * complete the login process and should be disconnected
     * immediately.
     *
     * @param session a client session
     * @return a (serializable) listener for the client session,
